* A man who wants specific courses on getting better with women by gaining knowledge of game but can't because the courses are too expensive, and 
he can't get them for free.
* A man who wants specific courses on finances (forex, stocks, real estate, business) so he can begin investing, but can't because the courses are
too expensive and he can't get them for free.

Where?
Youtube channels, reddit. And the places, the owners of the courses market to.

Bait? Very expensive and wanted courses on seduction, self improvement and persuasion at $2.99, close to free education.

What? A platform where they can purchase multiple courses that are very expensive at a very cheap price.

Market sustainability. Very sustainable, because: 
* Extremely low fixated prices. 
* There will always be people who are insecure and would like to improve themselves.
* The original owners of the courses will do the marketing for people to buy their courses, our only job is to bring to attention those people
to our platform.

Effort. Very little effort, we get our courses on the platform using an api from pdscourses and fttuts, later we can build more apis by buying
life subscriptions from other platforms such as ours, but their prices are very expensive. If the platforms don't have a course that our customers
want, or we found a specific one, we can personally update it.

Time & profit. Our initial investment is $12,000 without including the cost of traffic.
Minimum: 300 hours.
Web developer at your level makes minimum: $40.
Meaning to just meet even to your time, you'll need $12,000, cashflow. Let's say on average you 5 people a month buying you $15 worth of courses,
that's $75 a month. It'll take you 13 years just to meet even with your investment. 

Service. An extremely well service to people wanting to improve themselves.

Risk. Low risk, we have the code. Worst scenario they take the website down, we'll build it back up, that's why we'll have an email list.
